# Semagrams

A *semagram* is a flexible structure for encoding the semantics of a given concept via a slot-filler structure.

This "semagram base” [1] is the result of a systematic analysis, unification and extension of semantic relations (or slots) derived from different resources:

    ANW dictionary [2]
    Visual Attributes [3]
    Property Norms [4]


# Authors
This project is the first result of the collaboration between:

- <a href="https://luigidicaro.me/">Dr. Luigi Di Caro</a> (University of Turin) and
- <a href="http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/">Prof. Roberto Navigli</a> (University Sapienza of Rome). 

Two PhD students contributed to the annotation and the semi-automatic development of the released resource:

- Valentina Leone (PhD student at the University of Turin)
- Giovanni Siragusa (PhD student at the University of Turin)
